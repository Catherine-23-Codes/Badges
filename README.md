# GitHub Badges Reference---

This repo is my quick reference for all kinds of **GitHub badges** â€” build status, version, downloads, license, and more...

This repository serves as:

1. A **reference sheet** for badge styles and sources.
2. A **ready-to-use code bank** for quick integration into `README.md` files.

This repo stores **all my GitHub-related badges** for quick use in future projects.
