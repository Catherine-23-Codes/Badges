#  GitHub Badges Reference 

This repo is my quick reference for all kinds of **GitHub badges** — build status, version, downloads, license, and more.

This repository serves as:
1. A **reference sheet** for badge styles and sources.
2. A **ready-to-use code bank** for quick integration into `README.md` files.
